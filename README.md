# ZIH HPC Documentation

This repository contains the documentation of the HPC systems and services provided at
[TU Dresden/ZIH](https://tu-dresden.de/zih/).

## Setup

We decided against a classical wiki software. Instead, we make use of the static site generator
[mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). It creates static html files from markdown source files. All
(configuration, layout and content) files will be managed within this git repository. The
documentation pages and configuration files are found in the folder `doc.zih.tu-dresden.de`. The
generated static html files, i.e, the documentation, is deployed to a web server. Several checks
within the CI/CD pipeline help to ensure a high quality documentation.

## Reporting Issues
