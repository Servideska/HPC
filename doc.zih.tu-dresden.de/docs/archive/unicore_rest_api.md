# UNICORE access via REST API

!!! warning

    This page is outdated! The UNICORE support has been abandoned and so this way of access is no
    longer available.

Most of the UNICORE features are also available using its REST API.

* This API is documented here:
    * [https://sourceforge.net/p/unicore/wiki/REST_API/](https://sourceforge.net/p/unicore/wiki/REST_API/)
* Some useful examples of job submission via REST are available at:
    * [https://sourceforge.net/p/unicore/wiki/REST_API_Examples/](https://sourceforge.net/p/unicore/wiki/REST_API_Examples/)
* The base address for the system at the ZIH is:
    * `unicore.zih.tu-dresden.de:8080/TAURUS/rest/core`
