# Venus open to HPC projects

The new HPC server [Venus](SystemVenus) is open to all HPC projects
running on Mars with a quota of 20000 CPU h for testing the system.
Projects without access to Mars have to apply for the new resorce.

To increase the CPU quota beyond this limit, a follow-up (but full)
proposal is needed. This should be done via the new project management
system.
