# Nanoscale Simulations

## ABINIT

[ABINIT](http://www.abinit.org) is a package whose main program allows one to find the total energy,
charge density and electronic structure of systems made of electrons and nuclei (molecules and
periodic solids) within Density Functional Theory (DFT), using pseudopotentials and a planewave
basis. ABINIT also includes options to optimize the geometry according to the DFT forces and
stresses, or to perform molecular dynamics simulations using these forces, or to generate dynamical
matrices, Born effective charges, and dielectric tensors. Excited states can be computed within the
Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (for molecules), or within Many-Body Perturbation Theory
(the GW approximation).

ABINIT is available as [modules](modules.md). Installed versions can be listed and loaded with the
following commands

```console
marie@login$ module avail ABINIT
---------------------------- /sw/modules/scs5/chem -----------------------------

## CP2K

[CP2K](http://cp2k.berlios.de/) performs atomistic and molecular simulations of solid state, liquid,
molecular and biological systems. It provides a general framework for different methods such as e.g.
density functional theory (DFT) using a mixed Gaussian and plane waves approach (GPW), and classical
pair and many-body potentials.

CP2K is available as [modules](modules.md). Available packages can be listed and loaded with the
following commands:

```console
marie@login$ module avail CP2K

## Gaussian

Starting from the basic laws of quantum mechanics, [Gaussian](http://www.gaussian.com) predicts the
energies, molecular structures, and vibrational frequencies of molecular systems, along with
numerous molecular properties derived from these basic computation types. It can be used to study
molecules and reactions under a wide range of conditions, including both stable species and
compounds which are difficult or impossible to observe experimentally such as short-lived
intermediates and transition structures.

Access to the Gaussian installation on our system is limited to members
of the  UNIX group `s_gaussian`. Please, contact
[hpcsupport@zih.tu-dresden.de](mailto:hpcsupport@zih.tu-dresden.de) if you can't
access it, yet wish to use it.

### Guidance on Data Management with Gaussian

We have a general description about
[how to utilize workspaces for your I/O intensive jobs](../data_lifecycle/workspaces.md).
However hereafter we have an example on how that might look like for Gaussian:

???+ example "Using workspaces with Gaussian"

    ```
    #!/bin/bash

    #SBATCH --partition=haswell
    #SBATCH --time=96:00:00
    #SBATCH --nodes=1
    #SBATCH --ntasks=1
    #SBATCH --constraint=fs_lustre_ssd
    #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=24
    #SBATCH --mem-per-cpu 2050
    # only 2050 MB RAM for haswell, as Gaussian somehow crashes if we try using the full 2541 of it

    # Load the software you need here
    module purge
    module load modenv/hiera
    module load Gaussian

    # Adjust the path to where your input file is located
    INPUTFILE="/path/to/my/inputfile.gjf"

    test ! -f "${INPUTFILE}" && echo "Error: Could not find the input file ${INPUTFILE}" && exit 1

    # Allocate workspace. Adjust time span to time limit of the job (-d <N>).
    COMPUTE_DIR=gaussian_${SLURM_JOB_ID}
    export GAUSS_SCRDIR=$(ws_allocate -F ssd -n ${COMPUTE_DIR} -d 7)
    echo ${GAUSS_SCRDIR}

    # Check allocation.
    test -z "${GAUSS_SCRDIR}" && echo "Error: Cannot allocate workspace ${COMPUTE_DIR}" && exit 1

    # Change to workspace directory and execute application
    cd ${GAUSS_SCRDIR}
    srun g16 < "${INPUTFILE}" > logfile.log

    # Save result files into user home
    # Compress results with bzip2 (which includes CRC32 Checksums)
    bzip2 --compress --stdout -4 "${GAUSS_SRCDIR}" > ${HOME}/gaussian_job-${SLURM_JOB_ID}.bz2
    RETURN_CODE=$?
    COMPRESSION_SUCCESS="$(if test ${RETURN_CODE} -eq 0; then echo 'TRUE'; else echo 'FALSE'; fi)"

    # Clean up workspace
    if [ "TRUE" = ${COMPRESSION_SUCCESS} ]; then
        test -d ${GAUSS_SCRDIR} && rm -rf ${GAUSS_SCRDIR}/*
        # Reduces grace period to 1 day!
        ws_release -F ssd ${COMPUTE_DIR}
    else
        echo "Error with compression and writing of results"
        echo "Please check the folder \"${GAUSS_SRCDIR}\" for any partial(?) results."
        exit 1
    fi
    ```

## GROMACS

GROMACS is a versatile package to perform molecular dynamics, i.e. simulate the Newtonian equations
of motion for systems with hundreds to millions of particles. It is primarily designed for
biochemical molecules like proteins, lipids and nucleic acids that have a lot of complicated bonded
interactions, but since GROMACS is extremely fast at calculating the nonbonded interactions (that
usually dominate simulations), many groups are also using it for research on non-biological systems,
e.g., polymers. For documentations see [GROMACS homepage](https://www.gromacs.org/).

GROMACS is available as [modules](modules.md). Available packages can be listed and loaded with the
following commands:

```console
marie@login$:~> module avail GROMACS
----------------------------- /sw/modules/scs5/bio -----------------------------
   GROMACS/2018.2-foss-2018a-CUDA-9.2.88    GROMACS/2019.4-fosscuda-2019a
   GROMACS/2018.2-intel-2018a               GROMACS/2020-fosscuda-2019b   (D)

## NAMD

[NAMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd) is a parallel molecular dynamics code designed for
high-performance simulation of large biomolecular systems.

NAMD can be started as parallel program with `srun`. Since
the parallel performance strongly depends on the size of the given problem, one cannot give a general
advice for the optimum number of CPUs to use. (Please check this by running NAMD with your molecules
and just a few time steps.)

NAND is available as [modules](modules.md). Available packages can be listed and loaded with the
following commands:

```console
marie@login$:~> module avail NAMD
---------------------------- /sw/modules/scs5/chem -----------------------------
   NAMD/2.12-intel-2018a-mpi
[...]
marie@login$ module load NAMD
[...]
Module NAMD/2.12-intel-2018a-mpi and 12 dependencies loaded.
```

Any published work which utilizes NAMD shall include the following reference:

*James C. Phillips, Rosemary Braun, Wei Wang, James Gumbart, Emad Tajkhorshid, Elizabeth Villa, Christophe
Chipot, Robert D.  Skeel, Laxmikant Kale, and Klaus Schulten. Scalable molecular dynamics with NAMD.

Electronic documents will include a direct link to the [official NAMD page](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd)

## ORCA

ORCA is a flexible, efficient and easy-to-use general purpose tool for quantum chemistry with
specific emphasis on spectroscopic properties of open-shell molecules. It features a wide variety of
standard quantum chemical methods ranging from semiempirical methods to DFT to single- and
multireference correlated ab initio methods. It can also treat environmental and relativistic
effects.

To run ORCA jobs in parallel, you have to specify the number of processes in your input file (here
for example 16 processes):

```Bash
%pal nprocs 16 end
```

Note, that ORCA spawns MPI processes itself, so you must not use `srun` to launch it in your batch
file. Just set `--ntasks` to the same number as in your input file and call the `orca` executable
directly. For parallel runs, it must be called with the full path:

```Bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --ntasks=16
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=2000M

$ORCA_ROOT/orca example.inp
```

ORCA is available as [modules](modules.md). Available packages can be listed and loaded with the
following commands:

```console
marie@login$:~> module avail ORCA
---------------------------- /sw/modules/scs5/chem -----------------------------
   ORCA/4.1.1-OpenMPI-2.1.5    ORCA/4.2.1-gompi-2019b (D)
[...]
marie@login$ module load ORCA
[...]
Module ORCA/4.2.1-gompi-2019b and 11 dependencies loaded.
