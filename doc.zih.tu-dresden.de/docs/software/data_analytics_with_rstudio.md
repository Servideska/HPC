# Data Analytics with RStudio

[RStudio](<https://rstudio.com/) is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It includes
a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for
plotting, history, debugging and workspace management. RStudio is also available on ZIH systems.

The easiest option is to run RStudio in JupyterHub directly in the browser. It can be started
similarly to a new kernel from [JupyterLab](../access/jupyterhub.md#jupyterlab) launcher.

???tip
    If an error "could not start RStudio in time" occurs, try reloading the web page with F5.

???note
    Please note that it is currently not recommended to use an interactive x11 job with the
    desktop version of RStudio, as described, for example, in introduction to HPC-DA slides.
