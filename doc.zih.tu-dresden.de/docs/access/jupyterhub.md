# JupyterHub

With our JupyterHub service, we offer you a quick and easy way to work with
Jupyter notebooks on ZIH systems. This page covers starting and stopping
JupyterHub sessions, error handling and customizing the environment.

We also provide a comprehensive documentation on how to use
[JupyterHub for Teaching (git-pull feature, quickstart links, direct links to notebook files)](jupyterhub_for_teaching.md).

## Disclaimer

!!! warning

    The JupyterHub service is provided *as-is*, use at your own discretion.

Please understand that JupyterHub is a complex software system of which we are
not the developers and don't have any downstream support contracts for, so we
merely offer an installation of it but cannot give extensive support in every
case.

## Access

!!! note
    This service is only available for users with an active HPC project.
    See [Application for Login and Resources](../application/overview.md), if
    you need to apply for an HPC project.

JupyterHub is available at
[https://taurus.hrsk.tu-dresden.de/jupyter](https://taurus.hrsk.tu-dresden.de/jupyter).

## Start a Session

Start a new session by clicking on the `Start my server` button.

A form opens up where you can customize your session. Our simple form
offers you the most important settings to start quickly.

![Simple form](misc/simple_form.png)
{: align="center"}

For advanced users, we have an extended form where you can change many settings. You can:

- modify batch system parameters to your needs ([more about batch system Slurm](../jobs_and_resources/slurm.md))
- assign your session to a project or reservation
- load modules from the [module system](../software/modules.md)
- choose a different standard environment (in preparation for future
  software updates or testing additional features)

![Advanced form](misc/advanced_form.png)
{: align="center"}

You can save your own configurations as additional presets. Those are
saved in your browser and are lost if you delete your browsing data. Use
the import/export feature (available through the button) to save your
presets in text files.

!!! info
    The partition [alpha](https://doc.zih.tu-dresden.de/hpc-wiki/bin/view/Compendium/AlphaCentauri)
    is available only in the extended form.

## Applications

You can choose between JupyterLab or classic Jupyter notebooks as outlined in the following.

### JupyterLab

![JupyterLab overview](misc/jupyterlab_overview.png)
{: align="center"}

The main workspace is used for multiple notebooks, consoles or
terminals. Those documents are organized with tabs and a very versatile
split screen feature. On the left side of the screen you can open
several views:

- file manager
- controller for running kernels and terminals
- overview of commands and settings
- details about selected notebook cell
- list of open tabs

### Classic Jupyter Notebook

Initially, your home directory is listed. You can open existing notebooks or
files by navigating to the corresponding path and clicking on them.

![Jupyter notebook file browser](misc/jupyter_notebook_file_browser.png)
{: align="center"}

Above the table on the right side, there is the button `New` which lets you create new
notebooks, files, directories or terminals.

## Jupyter Notebooks in General

In JupyterHub, you can create scripts in notebooks. Notebooks are programs which are split into
multiple logical code blocks. Each block can be executed individually. In between those code
blocks, you can insert text blocks for documentation. Each notebook is paired with a kernel running
the code. We currently offer one for Python, C++, MATLAB and R.

### Version Control of Jupyter Notebooks with Git

Since Jupyter notebooks are files containing multiple blocks for input code,
documentation, output and further information, it is difficult to use them with
Git. Version tracking of the `.ipynb` notebook files can be improved with the
[Jupytext plugin](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Jupytext will
provide Markdown (`.md`) and Python (`.py`) conversions of notebooks on the fly,
next to `.ipynb`. Tracking these files will then provide a cleaner Git history.
A further advantage is that Python notebook versions can be imported, allowing
to split larger notebooks into smaller ones, based on chained imports.

!!! note
    The Jupytext plugin is not installed on the ZIH system at the moment.
    Currently, it can be [installed](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
    by the users with parameter `--user`.
    Therefore, `ipynb` files need to be made available in a repository for shared
    usage within the ZIH system.

## Stop a Session

It is good practice to stop your session once your work is done. This releases
resources for other users and your quota is less charged. If you just log out or
close the window, your server continues running and **will not stop** until the
Slurm job runtime hits the limit (usually 8 hours).

At first, you have to open the JupyterHub control panel.

**JupyterLab**: Open the file menu and then click on `Logout`. You can
also click on `Hub Control Panel`, which opens the control panel in a new tab instead.

![JupyterLab logout](misc/jupyterlab_logout.png)
{: align="center"}

**Classic Jupyter notebook**: Click on the control panel button on the top right of your screen.

![Jupyter notebook control panel button](misc/jupyter_notebook_control_panel_button.png)
{: align="center"}

Now, you are back on the JupyterHub page and you can stop your server by clicking on
![Stop my server](misc/stop_my_server.png)
{: align="center"}

## Error Handling

We want to explain some errors that you might face sooner or later.
If you need help, open a ticket at [HPC support](mailto:hpcsupport@zih.tu-dresden.de).

### Error at Session Start

![Error batch job submission failed](misc/error_batch_job_submission_failed.png)
{: align="center"}

This message appears instantly, if your batch system parameters are not valid.
Please check those settings against the available hardware.
Useful pages for valid batch system parameters:

- [General information how to use Slurm](../jobs_and_resources/slurm.md)
- [Partitions and limits](../jobs_and_resources/partitions_and_limits.md)

### Error Message in JupyterLab

![JupyterLab error directory not found](misc/jupyterlab_error_directory_not_found.png)
{: align="center"}

If the connection to your notebook server unexpectedly breaks, you will get this
error message. Sometimes your notebook server might hit a batch system or
hardware limit and gets killed. Then, the log file of the corresponding
batch job usually contains useful information. These log files are located in your
home directory and have the name `jupyter-session-<jobid>.log`.

## Advanced Tips

### Standard Environments

The default Python kernel uses conda environments based on the
[Watson Machine Learning Community Edition (formerly PowerAI)](https://developer.ibm.com/linuxonpower/deep-learning-powerai/)
package suite. You can open a list with all included packages of the
exact standard environment through the spawner form:

![Environment package list](misc/environment_package_list.png)
{: align="center"}

This list shows all packages of the currently selected conda environment. This
depends on your settings for partition (CPU architecture) and standard
environment.

There are three standard environments:

- production
- test
- python-env-python3.8.6

**Python-env-python3.8.6** virtual environment can be used for all x86
partitions (`gpu2`, `alpha`, etc). It gives the opportunity to create a user
kernel with the help of a Python environment.

Here is a short list of some included software:

|            | generic\* | ml     |
|------------|-----------|--------|
| Python     | 3.6.10    | 3.6.10 |
| R\*\*      | 3.6.2     | 3.6.0  |
| WML CE     | 1.7.0     | 1.7.0  |
| PyTorch    | 1.3.1     | 1.3.1  |
| TensorFlow | 2.1.1     | 2.1.1  |
| Keras      | 2.3.1     | 2.3.1  |
| NumPy      | 1.17.5    | 1.17.4 |
| Matplotlib | 3.3.1     | 3.0.3  |

\* generic = all partitions except ml

\*\* R is loaded from the [module system](../software/modules.md)

### Creating and Using a Custom Environment

!!! info

    Interactive code interpreters which are used by Jupyter notebooks are called
    *kernels*. Creating and using your own kernel has the benefit that you can
    install your own preferred Python packages and use them in your notebooks.

We currently have two different architectures at ZIH systems.
Build your kernel environment on the **same architecture** that you want to use
later on with the kernel. In the examples below, we use the name
"my-kernel" for our user kernel. We recommend to prefix your kernels
with keywords like `haswell`, `ml`, `romeo`, `venv`, `conda`. This way, you
can later recognize easier how you built the kernel and on which hardware it
will work. Depending on that hardware, allocate resources:

=== "x86 nodes (e.g. partition `haswell`, `gpu2`)"
    ```console
    maria@login$ srun --pty --ntasks=1 --cpus-per-task=2 --mem-per-cpu=2541 --time=08:00:00 bash -l
    ```
=== "PowerPC nodes (partition `ml`)"
    ```console
    maria@login$ srun --pty --partition=ml --ntasks=1 --cpus-per-task=2 --mem-per-cpu=1443 \
     --time=08:00:00 bash -l
    ```

Create a virtual environment in your home directory. You can decide between
Python virtualenv or conda environment.

!!! note
    Please keep in mind that Python virtualenv is the preferred way to create a Python
    virtual environment.

#### Python Virtualenv

```console
marie@compute$ module load Python/3.8.6-GCCcore-10.2.0
Module Python/3.8.6-GCCcore-10.2.0 and 11 dependencies loaded.
marie@compute$ mkdir user-kernel # please use workspaces!
marie@compute$ cd user-kernel
marie@compute$ virtualenv --system-site-packages my-kernel
created virtual environment CPython3.8.6.final.0-64 in 5985ms
  creator CPython3Posix(dest=[...]/my-kernel, clear=False, global=True)
  seeder FromAppData(download=False, pip=bundle, setuptools=bundle, wheel=bundle, via=copy, app_data_dir=[...])
    added seed packages: pip==20.2.3, setuptools==50.3.0, wheel==0.35.1
  activators BashActivator,CShellActivator,FishActivator,PowerShellActivator,PythonActivator,XonshActivator
marie@compute$ source my-kernel/bin/activate
(my-kernel) marie@compute$ pip install ipykernel
Collecting ipykernel
[...]
Successfully installed [...] ipykernel-6.9.1 ipython-8.0.1 [...]
(my-kernel) marie@compute$ pip install --upgrade pip
(my-kernel) marie@compute$ python -m ipykernel install --user --name my-kernel --display-name="my kernel"
Installed kernelspec my-kernel in .../.local/share/jupyter/kernels/my-kernel
(my-kernel) marie@compute$ pip install [...] # now install additional packages for your notebooks
(my-kernel) marie@compute$ deactivate
```

#### Conda Environment

Load the needed module depending on partition architecture:

=== "x86 nodes (e.g. partition `haswell`, `gpu2`)"
    ```console
    marie@compute$ module load Anaconda3
    ```
=== "PowerPC nodes (partition `ml`)"
    ```console
    marie@ml$ module load PythonAnaconda
    ```

Continue with environment creation, package installation and kernel
registration:

```console
marie@compute$ mkdir user-kernel # please use workspaces!
marie@compute$ conda create --prefix $HOME/user-kernel/my-kernel python=3.8.6
Collecting package metadata: done
Solving environment: done
[...]
marie@compute$ conda activate $HOME/user-kernel/my-kernel
marie@compute$ conda install ipykernel
Collecting package metadata: done
Solving environment: done
[...]
marie@compute$ python -m ipykernel install --user --name my-kernel --display-name="my kernel"
Installed kernelspec my-kernel in [...]
marie@compute$ conda install [..] # now install additional packages for your notebooks
marie@compute$ conda deactivate
```

Now you can start a new session and your kernel should be available.

**JupyterLab**: Your kernels are listed on the launcher page:

![JupyterLab user kernel launcher](misc/jupyterlab_user_kernel_launcher.png)
{: align="center"}

You can switch kernels of existing notebooks in the menu:

![JupyterLab change kernel](misc/jupyterlab_change_kernel.png)
{: align="center"}

**Classic Jupyter notebook**: Your kernel is listed in the New menu:

![Jupyter notebook user kernel launcher](misc/jupyter_notebook_user_kernel_launcher.png)
{: align="center"}

You can switch kernels of existing notebooks in the kernel menu:

![Jupyter notebook change kernel](misc/jupyter_notebook_change_kernel.png)
{: align="center"}

!!! note
    Both python venv and conda virtual environments will be mention in the same
    list.

### Loading Modules

You have now the option to preload modules from the [module system](../software/modules.md).
Select multiple modules that will be preloaded before your notebook server
starts. The list of available modules depends on the module environment you want
to start the session in (`scs5` or `ml`). The right module environment will be
chosen by your selected partition.
