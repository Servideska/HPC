# ZIH HPC Documentation

This is the documentation of the HPC systems and services provided at
[TU Dresden's computing center ZIH](https://tu-dresden.de/zih/).

The purpose of the compendium is to build a knowledge base that gives the necessary information and
generalized examples in order to get you set up and started on the HPC systems. It describes best
practices on how things are done to help you establish a workflow so you can start your research.

The compendium is not meant to be a software documentation that describes every possible parameter
of every implemented function, thus, does not claim completeness, but is rather updated on a
continuous basis to add information based on experiences and your questions to the
[HPC Support](support/support.md) ticket system.

If the provided HPC systems and services helped to advance your research, please cite us. This is
important and helps us to continue to offer our resources and services. Please refer to the
[Acknowledgement](https://doc.zih.tu-dresden.de/application/acknowledgement/) section for examples.
