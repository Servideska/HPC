# Project Request Form Jards

This page describes the steps to fill the form on
[https://hpcprojekte.zih.tu-dresden.de/](https://hpcprojekte.zih.tu-dresden.de/application/). 

If you have not already reached the login form through a specialized page,
here you have an overview of the possible project applications.
There are technical and scientific reviews of the project applications,
which vary depending on the type of application.

Since 2021, HPC at universities has been restructured by the NHR network.
The network consists of nine centers, which operate the systems and offer
a coordinated consulting service on the methodological competence of scientific HPC.
The aim is to provide scientists at German universities with computing capacity
for their research and to strengthen their skills in the efficient use of this resource.

Due to the structuring there are different ways to access [HPC resources](https://doc.zih.tu-dresden.de/jobs_and_resources/hardware_overview/).

## Workflow

There are several steps for a project application ...

- Selection which kind of project proposal is applicable &rarr; [Kind of Application](#kind-of-application)
- Login to the application portal &rarr; [Login](#login)
- Managing one or several applications in the application portal &rarr; [Jards Frontend](#jards-frontend)
- Details for each project application &rarr; [Application](#application)
- Finalize and submit your application &rarr; [Finalized Application](#finalized-application)

Afterwards, the submitted application undergoes a technical and scientific
review and you will be informed about the result in 1 to N work days.
If a project is granted, you can use the project management portal
[https://hpcprojekte.zih.tu-dresden.de/](https://hpcprojekte.zih.tu-dresden.de/application/).

All steps for an application are documented in detail below.

### Kind of Application

Since January 2021 ZIH, TU Dresden is a NHR-center (Nationales Hochleistungsrechnen).
More details can be found in [https://tu-dresden.de/zih/hochleistungsrechnen/nhr-center](https://tu-dresden.de/zih/hochleistungsrechnen/nhr-center).

At ZIH, TU Dresden we have 3 different kinds of application
for applying for HPC resources: NHR, Saxony and TUD/TIER3.

??? abstract "Project Type"

    ### Project Type

    After a new project application is created you can choose a

    * **Trial project**: With a trial projects you can test
      whether the HPC resources meet your requirements.
      Trial projects are all applications with up to 3500 CPUh/month
      or 250 GPUh/month. No detailed project description is required.
    * **Regular project**: A regular project are for data intensive and
      compute intensive HPC applications, e.g. FEM, CFD and MD simulations.
      Regular projects have higher resource requirements than the trial projects.
      A detailed project description is required in addition to the online application.
    * **Courses**: Courses is a project type for teaching courses,
      where you can enable up to 5000 CPUh/month, without additional
      communication. If there is a higher resource requirement needed,
      it can be enabled after consultation the HPC support.
      No detailed project description is required.
      Please be aware, that in exceptional cases, ZIH reserves the right
      to request a more detailed abstract.

    The project application differs depending on the type of
    application - and thus which components of our HPC system - resources are applied for.

    ![Project Type Selection][21]

??? abstract "Principal Investigator (PI) and Person to Contact (PC)"

    ### Principal Investigator (PI) and Person to Contact (PC)

    Choose the principal investigator and the person to contact.
    On the Button 'change my role ...' below, you can change your organisational part in the project.

    Keep in mind that the principal investigator (PI) has to be:

    * institute director
    * Professors
    * research group leader

    ![Principal Investigator (PI)][22]

    If you have not yet submitted an application to us, you will
    be asked to provide your personal information.

    ![Principal Investigator (PI)][23]
    ![Principal Investigator (PI)][24]

??? abstract "Resources"

    ### Resources

    Choose the needed resources. Typically, you can choose between GPU and CPU.
    If you are unsure about some of the detail questions here and below,
    please provide a rough estimate or your best guess instead of specifying 0 or no data.

    !!! info
        You can only choose after you have specified a project type.

    For each choosen resource there are some questions after the project data.

    ![Resource Selection][12]

    Questions for CPU resources could be:

    - How much computing time is required for your project in the upcoming
    compute time period of one year (in core-hours)?
    - What is your job size and how many cores do you need?
    - Define your memory: How many GB per core do you need?

    !!! hint "Hint"
        If you have chosen only CPU resources, please be aware to specify
        here only resources for pure CPU nodes. Resources needed on accelerators
        (GPUs) must be specified in the corresponding section. If you like
        to change your computing time requirements go one slide back.

    ![CPU][13]

    Questions for CPU resources could be:

    - How much computing time is required on GPU nodes for your HPC project (in GPU-hours)?
    - How many GPU do you use for a single job?
    - How much GB of memory do you use for your typical job?
    - Which GPU programming scheme (CUDA, OpenACC, etc.) do you use?
    - Which software do you deploy on GPUs (own code, third party)?

    !!! hint "Hint"
        If you have chosen both CPU and GPU resources, but you do not need
        compute time on GPUs type in 0 here to be able to continue with your
        project application in Jards.

    ![GPU][14]

??? abstract "Project Data"

    ### Project Data

    In this step, the basic conditions of the project must be specified.

    Depending on the selected project type, these can be different.

    For example:

    - How much time do you plan for your HPC project (add ending date)?
    - What is your title of your HPC project (max. 250 char)?
    - Define your keywords to explain your HPC project best.
    - Please add a short project description (max. 6000 char).
    - Explain your plans for this granting period (max. 500 char).
    - Are you doing commissioned research (yes/no)?
    - Who is sponsoring your HPC project?
    - Classify your HPC project according to the following main and sub categories.
    - Which methods (physical, mathematical, numerical, ...) are used?
    - Which reasons make the use of this supercomputer necessary?

    !!! hint "Commissioned Research"
        Are you doing commissioned research?

        Commissioned research means direct order by private third parties to the
        TU Dresden as well as indirect assignments by private third parties on a
        promoting institution (university , research institution, or similar institutions).
        All research projects sponsored by public institutions such as state, country DFG,
        EU etc. are excluded.

        This specification is very important. In the end you must confirm this information
        in writing. For this purpose, a PDF is generated, which you must send back to us.

    ![Project Data][28]
    ![Project Data][29]
    ![Project Data][30]

??? abstract "Software"

    ### Software

    Next you need to specify which software you want to use.

    Here are the following categories, you should answer:

    - Commercial Software Packages
    - Compilers
    - Programming Languages
    - Other packages, not named here.
    - Use own-developed packages, please name here and provide the links to
    the open source software.
    - Parallelization strategy

    !!!hint "Information About Required Software"
        This is important for us, because we need to see if the software is installed, there is a valid license and it is available under the appropriate architecture. The biggest problem is the imagination of the license writers. We have to abide by these conditions. Even if we try to provide the common HPC software including licenses, not every software vendor offers appropriate licenses.

    ![Software][31]
    ![Software][32]

??? abstract "Data Management"

    ### Data Management

    The last thing to specify is the I/O behavior. All this information helps us
    to check and, if necessary, to create the necessary conditions.

    For example:

    * How much memory do you need.
    * How do your calculations behave (many small files or one big file)?
    * Fetch data from external? How?

    ![Data][33]
    ![Data][34]

??? abstract "Upload Full Project description"

    ### Upload Full Project description

    If you are choosing the project type 'Regular project' a
    detailed project description is needed to complete the application.
    You can save the application form and add the detailed description later,
    before submitting and finalize the HPC project application.

    You can find a template on this page:
    [https://tu-dresden.de/zih/hochleistungsrechnen/zugang/projektantrag?set_language=en](https://tu-dresden.de/zih/hochleistungsrechnen/zugang/projektantrag?set_language=en).

### Finalized Application

The final step is to complete the application process.
The application is submitted to us and approved for review. Editing is no longer possible.

In the next step you will receive an email with the data of the application
as a PDF. In it you will find a template for the confirmation of the commissioned research.

![Finalize][18]

!!! danger "Important"
    Please send the confirmation of commissioned research signed back to us,
    even if it is not commissioned research.
