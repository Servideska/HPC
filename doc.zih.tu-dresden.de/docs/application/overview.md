# Application for Login and Resources

In order to use the ZIH systems installed at ZIH, a project application form has to be filled in.
The HPC project manager should hold a professorship (university) or head a research group. You may
also apply for a "Schnupperaccount" (trial account) for one year to find out if the machine is
useful for your application.

An other able use case is to request resources for a courses.

To learn more about applying for a project or a course,
check the following page: [https://tu-dresden.de/zih/hochleistungsrechnen/zugang][1]

## HPC-Login

### get access without an existing ZIH-Login

To use the resources you need a valid [IDM-Login][2]. To got an IDM-Login and the access to HPC you can use
[this Form][4].

### get access with a valid ZIH login

If a project already exists and a user with a valid ZIH login wants 
to use HPC resources, it is enough to add the user via the [manager view][3]. 
The manager view can be used by project managers and project administrators.

## Acknowledgment in Publications

To provide you with modern and powerful HPC systems in future as well, 
we have to show that these systems help to advance research. 
For that purpose we rely on your help.
In most cases, the results of your computations are used for 
presentations and publications, especially in peer-reviewed
magazines, journals, and conference proceedings. 
We kindly ask you to mention the HPC resource usage in the acknowledgment 
section of all publications that are based on granted HPC resources of the TU Dresden. 

Examples:

- The authors gratefully acknowledge the GWK support for funding 
  this project by providing computing time through the Center 
  for Information Services and HPC (ZIH) at TU Dresden.

- The authors are grateful to the Center for Information Services 
  and High Performance Computing [Zentrum fuer Informationsdienste 
  und Hochleistungsrechnen (ZIH)] at TU Dresden for providing 
  its facilities for high throughput calculations.

Please send us references of appeared publications, so that we can refer to them in the context of follow-up applications for the procurement of infrastructure!
