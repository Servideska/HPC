# Application for Login and Resources

In order to use the ZIH systems installed at ZIH, a project application form has to be filled in.
The HPC project manager should hold a professorship (university) or head a research group. You may
also apply for a "Schnupperaccount" (trial account) for one year to find out if the machine is
useful for your application.

An other able use case is to request resources for a courses.

To learn more about applying for a project or a course,
check the following page:

## HPC-Login

### get access without an existing ZIH-Login

To use the resources, you need a [valid ZIH login][2]. To get a ZIH login and the
access to HPC, please use the [HPC login application form][4]

### Get Access with a valid ZIH Login

When you have a valid ZIH login, there are two possibilities for you: Either the manager or
administrator of a HPC project needs to add you as a member of this project via the
[manager view][3], or you have to [apply for a project](project_request_form.md).
