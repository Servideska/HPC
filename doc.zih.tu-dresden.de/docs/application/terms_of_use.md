# Terms Of Use / Nutzungsbedingungen 

**Attention:** Only the German version of the Terms of Use is binding.

These new Terms of Use are valid from April 1, 2018: [HPC-Nutzungsbedingungen_20180305.pdf][1]

**The key points are are:**

- For support reasons, we store your contact data according to our [identity management system][5].
  (Will be anonymized at least 15 months after the cancellation of the HPC login.)
  The data of the HPC project (incl. contact of project leader) will be kept for
  further reference.
    -Our HPC resources may only be used according to the project description.
- Responsibilities for the project leader:
    - She has to assign a team member with an HPC login as the technical project
      administrator. She can do this herself if she has a login at our systems.
    - The project leader or the administrator will have to add/remove members to
      their project. She has access to accounting data for her project.
- These issues cover the data storage in our systems:
    - Please work in the scratch filesystems.
    - Upon request, the project leader or the administrator can be given access
      to a user's directory.
    - The scratch filesystems (/tmp, /scratch, /lustre/ssd) are for
      temporary use only. After a certain time, files may be removed
      automatically (for /tmp after 7 days, parallel scratch: after 100 days).
    - Before a user leaves a project the leader/administrator has to store away
      worthy data. For this, the storage services of ZIH (long term storage,
      intermediate archive) can be used.
- Project termination (**new**)
    - At project's end, jobs cannot be submitted and started any longer.
    - Logins are valid for 30 more days for saving data.
    - Hundred days after project termination, it's files will be deleted in
      the HPC filesystems.
- The HPC user agrees to follow the instructions and hints of the support
  team. In case of non-compliance, she can be disabled for the batch system
  or banned from the system.

- Working with logs and HPC performance data (**new**)
    - For HPC related research ZIH will collect and analyze
      performance data. Anonymized, it might be shared with research partners.
    - Log data will be kept for long term analyzes.

These key points are only a brief summary. If in doubt, please consult the German original.
