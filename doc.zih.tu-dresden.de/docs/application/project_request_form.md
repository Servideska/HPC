## Third step: Hardware

**some information how to estimate GPUh/CPUh is needed.**

This step inquire the required hardware. You can find the specifications
[here](../jobs_and_resources/hardware_overview.md).

Please fill in the total computing time you expect in the project runtime.  The compute time is
given in cores per hour (CPU/h), this refers to the 'virtual' cores for nodes with hyperthreading.
If they require GPUs, then this is given as GPU units per hour (GPU/h).  Please add 6 CPU hours per
GPU hour in your application.

The project home is a shared storage in your project.  Here you exchange data or install software
for your project group in userspace. The directory is not intended for active calculations, for this
the scratch is available.
