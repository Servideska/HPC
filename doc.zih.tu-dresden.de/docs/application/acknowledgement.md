# Acknowledgment

To provide you with modern and powerful HPC systems in future as well, we have to show that these
systems help to advance research. For that purpose we rely on your help. In most cases, the results
of your computations are used for presentations and publications, especially in peer-reviewed
magazines, journals, and conference proceedings. We kindly ask you to mention the HPC resource usage
in the acknowledgment section of all publications that are based on granted HPC resources of the TU
Dresden. Examples:

!!! example

    The authors gratefully acknowledge the GWK support for funding this project by providing
    computing time through the Center for Information Services and HPC (ZIH) at TU Dresden.

!!! example

    The authors are grateful to the Center for Information Services and High Performance Computing
    [Zentrum f端r Informationsdienste und Hochleistungsrechnen (ZIH)] at TU Dresden for providing its
    facilities for high throughput calculations.

!!! example

    Die Autoren danken Bund und Land Sachsen f端r die Unterst端tzung bei der Finanzierung dieses
    Projektes mit der Bereitstellung von Rechenzeit durch das Zentrum f端r Informationsdienste und
    Hochleistungsrechnen (ZIH) an der TU Dresden.
