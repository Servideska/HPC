# HPC Resources

The architecture specifically tailored to data-intensive computing, Big Data
analytics, and artificial intelligence methods with extensive capabilities for performance monitoring provides ideal conditions to achieve the ambitious research goals of the users and the ZIH.

## Overview

From the users' pespective, there are seperate clusters:

- **Barnard** - CPU cluster (2023)
- **Romeo** - CPU cluster (2020)
- **Alpha Centauri** - GPU cluster (2021)
- **Julia** - single SMP system (2021)
- **ML** - IBM Power/GPU system (2018)




They run with their own Slurm batch system. 


All clusters have access to these shared parallel file systems:

| File system | Usable directory | Capacity | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Lustre` | `/lustre/bulk` | 4 PB |
| `Lustre` | `/lustre/fast` | 40 TB | 
| `Weka` | `/weka` | 232 TB | 
| `Home` | `/home` | 95 GB |
