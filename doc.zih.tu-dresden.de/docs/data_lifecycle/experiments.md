# Structuring Experiments

This article provides recommendations for building and running experiments properly on the ZIH system.
Thereby, such an experiment consists of the following parts (at least some of them):

* Input data
* Software 
* source code and scripts
* ouptut data and calculation results
* log files
* metadata 
* backup
* archiving

A further aspect is a collaborative working style. 
Thus, creating a unified and consistent experiment environment for multiple users is essential. 
This is considered for all the following recommendations. 

# Data management 

limited space in user space 
workspaces
project directory


# Software environment

* Input data
* Calculation results
* Log files
* Submission scripts (examples / code for survival)
