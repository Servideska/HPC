# Introduction

The Center for Information Services and High Performance Computing (ZIH)
is a central scientific unit of TU Dresden with a strong competence in
parallel computing and software tools. We have a strong commitment to
support *real users*, collaborating to create new algorithms,
applications and to tackle the problems that need to be solved to create
new scientific insight with computational methods. Our compute complex
"Hochleistungs-Rechner-/-Speicher-Komplex" (HRSK) is focused on
data-intensive computing. High scalability, big memory and fast
I/O-systems are the outstanding properties of this project, aside from
the significant performance increase. The infrastructure is provided not
only to TU Dresden but to all universities and public research
institutes in Saxony.
