# HPC Data Management

To efficiently handle different types of storage systems, please design
your data workflow according to characteristics, like I/O footprint
(bandwidth/IOPS) of the application, size of the data, (number of
files,) and duration of the storage. In general, the mechanisms of
so-called** [Workspaces](WorkSpaces)** are compulsory for all HPC users
to store data for a defined duration - depending on the requirements and
the storage system this time span might range from days to a few years.
